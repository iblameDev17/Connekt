## 🔐 Security & Anonymity
The standout feature of Connekt—the **Ghost Zone**—is architected from the database-level to keep interactions 100% anonymous. User identifiers (UIDs) are never attached to posts or comments in the backend. Comprehensive Firebase Security Rules restrict read/write access securely to ensure complete privacy across all app interactions.
